# Guards Digital - Session Brief

Last updated: 2026-08-14

## Purpose and authority

Read this compact startup route once per new task before planning or changing the workspace. `AGENTS.md` controls process. [DOCUMENTATION_GOVERNANCE.md](DOCUMENTATION_GOVERNANCE.md) assigns each subject one canonical home; this brief alone owns current authorization and the exact next milestone route, while carrying only a compact implementation summary.

## Current implementation

The project has completed roadmap milestones through **6.2c**. The configured vertical slice uses a pure match application service, typed action handlers, authoritative projections, deterministic replay/Undo, map-bound snapshots, and passive Unity presentation; schema v9 persists current continuations, a paused effect frame, and placed token and attached marker components. It includes reload-safe Hero/minion combat and the end-of-round Minion Battle with serializable exact-count, one-at-a-time Heavy-last removal choices, now resolved by a configured player-facing prompt with board cues that forwards only the projected typed invocations; Lane-Push requests are recorded but not yet consumed. The exact subject-oriented inventory of implemented behavior, configured setup, compatibility boundaries, and remaining gaps lives in [Project/CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md](Project/CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md) and is maintained by subject rather than milestone chronology.

## Current authorization and next route

- Current completed milestone: **6.2c**.
- Active authorized milestone: **none**.
- Next proposed milestone: **6.3**.

Milestone **6.2c** completed on 2026-08-14, closing review findings `F62B-01` through `F62B-04` on their named checks, each observed failing pre-fix and passing post-fix. Skill's seams now meet the Movement/Attack bar: the projection computes Fast-Travel options only while no Skill frame is paused, refused Skill starts and effect-choice answers report Skill-specific typed reasons with Skill facts under their own turn event kind, `StartTurnSkill` revalidates offers through the shared Core prevalidation with a source-card precheck on the answer path, and snapshot restore re-derives paused capability candidates under input bindings rebuilt from persisted outcomes. The wire format is unchanged at schema v9 with every pinned digest unmoved. Milestone **6.3** is proposed next per the reassessed order (6.3 before 6.8 before 6.4); its 6.2b prerequisite is closed, `F62B-03`/`F62B-04` no longer stand before 6.7/6.4, and **6.10a** remains scheduled before 6.11, not authorized. Evidence lives in the completion commit, addressed from the [Phase 6 archive](Archive/Phase-Handoffs/PHASE_6.md).

Standing route exceptions: trigger-only milestone **6.1am** remains unordered until the rules ledger reaches its warning threshold, and **6.1y** remains unordered but required before 8.1. Exact sequencing lives in [Roadmap/PHASE_6_DOCUMENTATION.md](Roadmap/PHASE_6_DOCUMENTATION.md) and [Roadmap/PHASE_6.md](Roadmap/PHASE_6.md); scheduling is not authorization.

## Durable boundaries

- The private target remains an official-setup 3v3 pitch match with Wasp plus five later approved, source-verified heroes, retaining director mode and adding invite-only six-human internet validation before production presentation. Accounts, public matchmaking, public distribution, and production live-service scope remain excluded.
- Declared target platforms are Windows, macOS, and iOS as of 2026-08-13. Windows remains the active reference build target; macOS and iOS are declared, not supported, and iOS player work is unscheduled phase-scale work. See [Project/PRODUCT.md](Project/PRODUCT.md).
- Rules follow the second-printing rulebook, verified card data, and official rulings under [RULES_LEDGER.md](RULES_LEDGER.md). No rule may be invented, simplified, rebalanced, or silently reinterpreted.
- Pure rules/state remain independent of Unity presentation. Preserve definition/instance, action-offer, command/event, pending-choice, timing, versioning, typed effect/query, map-scoped identity, snapshot, and deterministic replay boundaries.
- The public source repository and rulebook are authorized under the user's 2026-08-13 permission confirmation. The extracted card corpus, map references, builds, and untracked material remain private; do not add or distribute them without separate explicit authorization and applicable rights.

## Targeted routing

Go straight to the shard that owns the subject when this table names it. When the owner is unknown or the task is cross-cutting, follow the index files per `AGENTS.md`; the hop is only wasted when the destination is already known.
